# QM9 GNN: Utilizing Graph Neural Networks to Predict Chemical Properties

GNN-based models achieve strong overall performance for HOMO–LUMO gap prediction on QM9, but error analysis reveals systematic weaknesses for aromatic and heteroatom-rich molecules. Attention mechanisms selectively improve predictions in these regimes, highlighting the importance of architecture choice and chemistry-aware evaluation beyond aggregate metrics.
